<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Since there&rsquo;s gonna be some chemistry in this, allow me to write this in English. Thanks to my respective and beloved teacher &ndash; Mr.Tuáº¥n. I&rsquo;ve come to realize my new limits, widen my horizon and break through normal boundaries. English tened by his invaluable words, I know now that teaching is more about making a man out of someone, not just knowledge reading or yelling. Thanks to him, to GMP, to everyone here, I thank you for helping me become the man I am today, for teaching me things I could never have learned. I will forever treasure it, deep down in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
