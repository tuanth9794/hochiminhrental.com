<p align="center"><strong>Nowadays, some employers th&shy;&shy;ink that formal academic qualifications are more important than life experience or personal qualities when they look for new employees. Why is in this case? Is a positive or negative development.</strong></p>

<p>In the contemporary world, despite numerous living proves achieving great fruitions without formal academic qualifications, in hiring employees, making decision based on such scholastic evidences might be biased for some kinds of job position. From my perspective, advantages of this prejudice cannot overwhelm its disadvantages. This essay will clarify some possible reasons for this priority and my point of view.</p>
<p>There are many reasons acting as a catalyst for the weight of diplomas in recruitment. Firstly, this has become a deep-rooted perception of hirers. In the past, when the ability and knowledge of humanity used to be rudimentary, the more intellectual properties people possessed, the more respect the community treated them with. This is the stage when wisdom was measured only by certificates and when the definition of personal experience stayed ambiguous. Gradually, submitting a curriculum full of academic background has become a norm in recruitment industry. Secondly, qualifications and degrees are persuasive and evaluable standards helping employers to select the most qualified and reliable candidates. Undeniably, companies would be pleased to minimize all risks by believing visible formal certifications instead of assessing an unobvious factor like life experience.</p>
<p>However, the long-lasting significance of academic requirement plays no role in defending its effectiveness. To begin with, knowledge taught in universities is so unpractical and theoretical that many organizations have to retrain their new employees. Undoubtedly, textbooks cannot provide a full picture of working environment, unpredictable clients, customary procedures in each company, and so on, leading to graduates&rsquo; confusion in adapting to new workplace and decreased productivity. Additionally, the amount of soft skills and personal qualities have become more apparent than before thanks to the discovery of EQ index. Therefore, as long as recruiters are willing to try giving applicants some psychological tests, they may succeed in hunting not only the best but also the most suitable for their firms.</p>
<p>From the foregoing, it is wiser to modify the recruitment process in this changing and flexible era, where the aptitude of human is no more limited in measurable figures or academic participation.</p>
