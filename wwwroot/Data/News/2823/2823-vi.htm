<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;I would love to tell you how I feel while studying with Ms.An that she is very enthusiastically in class and extremely supporting speaking teacher I&rsquo;ve met. With the knowledge you teach me, I&rsquo;m sure I will get high score in speaking IELTS exam. I would like to send Ms.An my appreciation and respect for what she has done. Thanks very much.&rdquo;</p>
